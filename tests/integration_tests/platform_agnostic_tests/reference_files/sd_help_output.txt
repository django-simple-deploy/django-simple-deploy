Customize django-simple-deploy's behavior:
  --automate-all        Automate all aspects of deployment. Create resources,

  --no-logging          Do not create a log of the configuration and
                        deployment process.
  --ignore-unclean-git  Run the deploy command even with an unclean `git
                        status` message.

Customize deployment configuration:
  --deployed-project-name DEPLOYED_PROJECT_NAME
                        Provide a name that the plugin will use for this
                        project.
  --region REGION       Specify the region that this project will be deployed
                        to.
