Thank you for your interest in helping out with `django-simple-deploy`. This project should be maintained as long as Django exists as a framework, so we really can use everyone's help.

There are many ways to contribute, and many reasons for contributing. This page is structured as a way to steer people into the most appropriate parts of the Contributing docs for their current situation.

This is a project focused on automating the configuration and deployoment of Django projects. That means it touches on a lot of different technologies, languages, and aspects of Django. There really is no one person who could be an expert on everything involved in this project. For example, no one is going to be an expert on the specific aspects of every platform that `django-simple-deploy` supports. That's especially true when you consider that employees of some of these platforms have already contributed to this project.

Minimum Qualifications (Beginners Welcome!)
---

Because this project focuses on deployment of working Django projects, and has a few base requirements, there are some minimum qualifications for contributing to the project:

- You need to know how to run a Django project on your local system.
- You need to have a basic understanding of using Git. To be more specific, you need to know how to make commits and check the current status of a project.
- You also need to know a little about working with GitHub. End users don't need to touch GitHub, but contributors need to know how to clone a project and interact over issues and discussions.
- You need to understand at least one of Python's dependency management systems. This could be using a bare `requirements.txt` file, using Poetry, or using Pipenv.

That's it! If you meet these criteria, you can get involved in this project.

Ways to contribute
---

There are enough ways to contribute, that each is described in a separate document. Choose the description that fits you best, and start contributing. :)

- If you have a long-term interest in contributing, please introduce yourself on the [Introductions](https://github.com/ehmatthes/django-simple-deploy/discussions/130) thread.
- If you're newer to Django or deployment and want to help out, the simplest way is to try using `django-simple-deploy` and report your results, even if everything works or nothing works. Start by documenting a [test run](test_run.md).
