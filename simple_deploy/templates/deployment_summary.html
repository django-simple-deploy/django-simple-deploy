<h1>Understanding your deployment</h1>

<p>This documentation was auto-generated by <i>django-simple-deploy</i>.</p>

<p>Now that your project is deployed on a live server that anyone can reach, you probably have some questions about how to maintain the deployment. Whichever platform you've chosen, you'll need to become familiar with that provider's documentation, and their approach to managing deployments. This deployment summary does not aim to take the place of your platform's official documentation; it only aims to help you find the easiest entry points into the official documentation.</p>

<p>What is my project's URL?</p>
<p><a href={{ project_url }}>{{ project_url }}</a></p>

<p>This was a practice deployment, how can I destroy the deployed version of the project?</p>
<p>You can either go to the Heroku dashboard, click on your app, go to settings, scroll to the bottom and click delete, or issue the following command:</p>
<p>$ heroku apps:destroy {{ heroku_app_name }}</p>
